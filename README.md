- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m working on architecture and the development, analysis are my hobbies (happy to connect in [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jiristeuer/) also)
- âš¡ [Real facts](https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/content/?keywords=%23gosh2inout&sortBy=%22date_posted%22):
  - "Almost everything is possible, it's just a matter of time, resources and quality", but the reality is about limited sources, it means "some things don't make sense to do because it takes a long time, a lot of resources, etc."
  - "If you want to show the reliability and quality ... show standard outputs, the test code coverage and vulnerability tests."
  - "Doing IT without IT is a beautiful idea ... fully functional only in the heads of an idealist and feasible in limited areas."
  - "Using the one universal hammer for everything is not always the best ... try to think about the differences and don't be lazy."
  - "How can you accelerate your innovation, simply? Reduce the quality, minimize effort in non-innovative areas such as tests, documentation, operations, security, etc."
  - "The truth must give way to a good story ... it is standard sales rules which can impacted all. Trust but verify, this applies 100% in IT."
  - "Added value does not end in perfectionism, but in the ability to connect things."
  - "The quality of the documentation will always be most appreciated by those who lack the documentation completely."
  - "Everyone makes mistakes, but only a donkey makes the same mistakes repeatedly, so feedback, a detailed look at the reasons for the failure and critical thinking are extremely important."
  - "You can run as fast as you want to the goal, but you won't reach the one ... consider your position on the map and relevant direction => Don't forget identify your maturity level ..."
  - etc.
